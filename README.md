# JS Advent of Code 2023
This is my personal advent of code 2023 repo. I used a templating system to streamline redundant boilerplate. The templating system could be abstracted to setup the system for different languages. Another consideration is implenting a webscraper with the necessary account authentication to pull the necessary data down into a file to further reduce redundencies. I will be putting my solutions in the solutions branch and keeping the templating here in master.
## Requirements
1. Nodejs
2. Jest
## Instructions
1. Clone the repo
2. Run:
   chmod +x create_day.sh
3. For each indiviudal day:
    bash create_day.sh
